A Lattice-Boltzmann code for solving coupled equations in electrohydrodynamics. 
Three collision operators are implemented for the (incompressible) Navier-Stokes, 
Nernst-Planck (advection-diffusion) and Poission's equation for electrostatics 
respectively. Various implementations of Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions 
are also implemented. The code deals (so far) only with 2D systems.

This code is part of a  master thesis project carried out at Chalmers University, 
Gothenburg. The accompanying report is available upon request (email me). 

Technical overview:
 Collision operators:
   BGK:
	+ Navier-Stokes
     - Shan-Chen force implementation
	+ Advection-diffusion
	+ Poisson's equation
 Boundary conditions:
  + Bounce back (Full way implementation)
  + Slip (Mirror reflection)
  + Periodic
  + He/Zou Constant density
  + He/Zou Constant velocity
 Boundary conditions (Not yet fully implemented)
  + LPM Neumann (From Wang paper) [NYFI]
  + He/Zou Constant velocity [NYFI]
  + BFL (Bouzidi's rule) [NYFI]

Examples:
 + Poiseuille flow
  - Driven by pressure grad.
  - Constant velocity driven
  - Force driven
 + Taylor-Green Vortex
 + Cylindrical obstacle
  - Bounce back
  - BFL 
 + 1D Poison-Boltzmann vs. Nernst-Planck
 + 2D Helmholtz equation (Wang+Chai)
 + 1D Advection-diffusion of point mass

Compile and run:
 1. Add source file to make file (temporary solution)
 2. $ make
 3. $ ./a.out

Further notes:
 In a near future, the make lattice-Boltzmann code will be separated from the
 examples and be compliled into a library.
