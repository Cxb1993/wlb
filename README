A Lattice-Boltzmann code for solving coupled equations in electrohydrodynamics. Three
collision operators are implemented for the (incompressible) Navier-Stokes, Nernst-Planck (advection-diffusion) 
and Poission's equation for electrostatics respectively. Various implementations of Dirichlet/Neumann 
boundary conditions are also implemented. The code deals (so far) only with 2D systems.

This code is part of a  master thesis project carried out at Chalmers University, Gothenburg. 
The accompanying report is available upon request (email me).
